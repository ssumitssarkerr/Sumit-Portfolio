# Sumit Sarker — Portfolio

This is a portfolio site updated to match the style and transitions from the Web Design Mastery example.

How to preview locally (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "e:\Portfolio for sumit 02"
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Quick deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the project to it.
2. In repository Settings -> Pages, select branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and root folder `/`.
3. Save — GitHub will publish the site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

If you'd like, I can:
- Prepare a quick `gh-pages` deploy script
- Help push this repo to GitHub and enable Pages
- Or create a ZIP of the project for download

Files changed/added:
- `index.html` — restructured to follow the reference layout
- `styles.css` — full visual restyle and responsive tweaks
- `main.js` — ScrollReveal + menu toggle
- `README.md` — preview and deploy instructions

Next steps I can take:
- Replace placeholder images with optimized images you provide
- Fine-tune colors/spacing to your exact preference
- Help publish to GitHub Pages and give a public URL
