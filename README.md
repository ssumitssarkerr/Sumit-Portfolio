# Sumit Sarker â€” Portfolio

This is a portfolio site updated to match the style and transitions from the Web Design Mastery example.

How to preview locally (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "e:\Sumit Portfolio "
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

This is a project file of my portfolio Website, just a random start I will make changes later
