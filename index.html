        <p class="about__bio">
            Sumit Sarker is an oceanography graduate specializing in marine climate hazards, remote sensing, and 
            environmental modelling. Growing up near the Meghna estuarine coastline, he developed a deep interest in 
            coastal processes and ecosystem vulnerability. Sumit has conducted extensive research on marine heatwaves in 
            the Bay of Bengal, flood susceptibility mapping using machine learning, and microplastics pollution in 
            estuarine environments. 
            <br><br>
            With multiple conference presentations, poster awards, and collaborations across environmental and GIS-based 
            projects, he aims to contribute to advanced ocean–atmosphere research and pursue graduate studies in marine or 
            environmental science. His long-term goal is to support climate-resilient coastal management and sustainable 
            ocean resource governance.
